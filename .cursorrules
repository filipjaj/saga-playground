# Lessons
- The API environment system can be extended to support custom URLs by adding a "custom" value to the API_URLS object
- The UI for environment selection can be changed from a simple toggle to a dropdown with custom input option
- Custom state needs to be maintained in context for user-provided values
- UI components should provide clear visual feedback for validation states
- Form inputs with validation should include helpful error messages
- Tooltips can provide additional context for UI actions without cluttering the interface
- Using Card components helps organize related UI elements in a visually appealing way
- Icons help users quickly identify different options in a dropdown

# Scratchpad
## Custom API URL Implementation Task
[X] Analyze the current implementation of API environment toggle and context
[X] Add "custom" option to API_URLS in config/api.ts
[X] Update APIEnvironmentContext to support custom URL state
[X] Enhance APIEnvironmentToggle component with dropdown and custom URL input
[X] Test the implementation (this step needs to be verified by the user)

Task completed: Modified the API environment toggle to support custom API URLs, allowing users to switch between Production, Beta, and Custom environments with a dropdown selector. When "Custom" is selected, an input field appears where users can enter their own API URL.

## UI/UX Improvement Task
[X] Add Card component for better organization
[X] Implement environment-specific icons
[X] Add URL validation with visual feedback
[X] Create save button with tooltips and status indicators
[X] Add confirmation messages for current API state
[X] Install necessary dependencies (@radix-ui/react-tooltip)
[X] Create required UI components (Card, Tooltip)

Task completed: Enhanced the API Environment Toggle with a significantly improved UI/UX that includes validation, better visual organization, clear feedback, and a more professional appearance.
